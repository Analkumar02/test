# Order Summary Refactoring

## Overview

The OrderSummary section of the CheckOut page has been refactored into smaller, more maintainable components. This refactoring improves code organization, makes it easier to maintain, and allows for better component reusability.

## Components Created

### Main Component

- **OrderSummarySection.js**: The parent component that orchestrates all the order summary functionality.

### Sub-Components

1. **OrderSummarySections/CouponSection.js**: Handles coupon input, validation, and display of success/error messages.
2. **OrderSummarySections/DemoProductSection.js**: Displays the demo product that users can add to their cart.
3. **OrderSummarySections/SubscriptionUpgrade.js**: Manages the subscription upgrade functionality, including:
   - Displaying one-time purchase products that can be upgraded
   - Handling the delivery frequency selection
   - Showing the success message after upgrading
   - Providing the option to undo the upgrade
4. **OrderSummarySections/OrderSummaryDetails.js**: Shows the price breakdown including subtotal, discounts, shipping, tax, and total.
5. **TrustBadges.js**: Displays trust badges to increase customer confidence.

## Implementation Details

Each component has:

- Its own set of styled components for better style encapsulation
- Descriptive prop names for better readability
- Clear separation of concerns

## How to Use

To use the Order Summary in the CheckOut page:

```jsx
<OrderSummarySection
  cartItems={cartItems}
  imagePath={imagePath}
  handleRemoveItem={handleRemoveItem}
  couponApplied={couponApplied}
  couponDiscount={couponDiscount}
  formData={formData}
  handleCouponApply={handleCouponApply}
  couponError={couponError}
  showCouponSuggestion={showCouponSuggestion}
  hasDemoProduct={hasDemoProduct}
  handleAddDemoProduct={handleAddDemoProduct}
  subscriptionUpgraded={subscriptionUpgraded}
  subscriptionSavings={subscriptionSavings}
  deliveryFrequency={deliveryFrequency}
  handleDismissUpgradeSuccess={handleDismissUpgradeSuccess}
  hasOneTimePurchaseProducts={hasOneTimePurchaseProducts}
  oneTimePurchaseProducts={oneTimePurchaseProducts}
  calculateSavings={calculateSavings}
  setDeliveryFrequency={setDeliveryFrequency}
  handleUpgradeToSubscription={handleUpgradeToSubscription}
  handleUndoUpgrade={handleUndoUpgrade}
  subtotal={subtotal}
  shipping={shipping}
  tax={tax}
  total={total}
  getShippingMethodName={getShippingMethodName}
/>
```

## Benefits of This Refactoring

1. **Improved Readability**: Each component focuses on a specific piece of functionality
2. **Easier Maintenance**: Updates to one part of the order summary won't affect others
3. **Better Testing**: Components can be tested in isolation
4. **Enhanced Reusability**: Components can be reused in other parts of the application
5. **Code Organization**: Cleaner file structure with logical component grouping

## Next Steps for Further Improvement

1. Implement proper TypeScript typing for component props
2. Add unit tests for each component
3. Create storybook stories for component documentation
4. Consider adding loading states for asynchronous operations (e.g., coupon application)
5. Implement responsive design improvements for mobile devices
